#' knitr (perhaps a play on “neater”) is a package that automates report generation. 
#' Typically, you’d write a statistical report by copying and pasting the relevant results of your 
#' analysis into a word processor and typing in additional information about these results. 
#' This process is error-prone due to the amount of manual work and the multitasking between analysis
#' and writing.

#' knitr dynamically generates reports from R code by combining chunks of code with their corresponding 
#' descriptions. This way, whenever you compile a document, any changes made to the R code will reflect in 
#' the corresponding section in the report. knitr is especially useful if you’re a researcher or need to 
#' generate reports of your data analyses. It can integrate your R code into many formats such as Markdown 
#' and LaTeX, or even create a report in HTML.
